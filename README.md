## To build and run the program:

1. Save all files in the same directory
2. Run make to build
3. Run `cat program.bin | ./svm` to execute a program


## Still need to:
- [ ] Finish implementing the core functions (already prototyped)
- [ ] Add the remaining instruction implementations in processor.c
- [ ] Enhance error checking and validation
- [ ] Add more detailed documentation
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Add debugging output capabilities
